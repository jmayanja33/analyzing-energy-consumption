    - ADF-Statistic: -1.431012205379043
    - P-Value: 0.8515774278883161
    - Number of Lags: 12
    - Number of Observations: 187
    - Critical Values: {'1%': -4.00801576357394, '5%': -3.4342334139298014, '10%': -3.140992402675066}
    
** Since the p-value (0.8515774278883161) is not less than the significance value (0.05), the null hypothesis IS NOT rejected, so the series IS NOT deemed stationary. **
