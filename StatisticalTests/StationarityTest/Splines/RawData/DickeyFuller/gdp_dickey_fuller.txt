    - ADF-Statistic: 18.49335624478336
    - P-Value: 1.0
    - Number of Lags: 6
    - Number of Observations: 193
    - Critical Values: {'1%': -4.006459103160539, '5%': -3.4334870817591234, '10%': -3.1405553762127636}
    
** Since the p-value (1.0) is not less than the significance value (0.05), the null hypothesis IS NOT rejected, so the series IS NOT deemed stationary. **
