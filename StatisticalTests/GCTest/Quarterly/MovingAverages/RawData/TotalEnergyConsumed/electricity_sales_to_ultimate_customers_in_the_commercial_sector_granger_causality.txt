- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.7711
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.7691
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.7691
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.7711
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.8344
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.8303
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.8304
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.8344
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0009
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0005
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0007
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0009
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0225
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0155
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0183
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0225
RESULT:
                
    50.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Commercial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed.
