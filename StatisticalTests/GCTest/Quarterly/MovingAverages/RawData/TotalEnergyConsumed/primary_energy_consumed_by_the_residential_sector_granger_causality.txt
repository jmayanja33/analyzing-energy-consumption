GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.3952
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.3904
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.3909
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.3952
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1056
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0968
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0996
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1056
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0097
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0068
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0081
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0097
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0304
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0217
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.025
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0304
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.2839
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.2458
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.2552
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.2839
RESULT:
                
    40.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed.
