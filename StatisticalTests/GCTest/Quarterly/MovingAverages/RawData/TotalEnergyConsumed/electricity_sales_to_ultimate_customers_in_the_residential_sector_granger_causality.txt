- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0036
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.003
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0033
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0036
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0001
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1277
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1126
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1172
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1277
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0014
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0007
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.001
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0014
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed.
