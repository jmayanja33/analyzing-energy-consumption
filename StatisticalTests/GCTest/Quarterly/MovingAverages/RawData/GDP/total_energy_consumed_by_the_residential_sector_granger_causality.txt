GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE GDP       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0276
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0253
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0262
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0276
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0083
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0064
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0073
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0083
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0438
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0355
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0386
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0438
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1589
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1356
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1423
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1589
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES GDP.
