GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0046
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0039
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0043
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0046
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0199
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0165
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0179
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0199
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0159
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0117
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0135
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0159
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0622
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0482
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.053
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0622
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.129
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1014
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1097
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.129
RESULT:
                
    65.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES GDP.
