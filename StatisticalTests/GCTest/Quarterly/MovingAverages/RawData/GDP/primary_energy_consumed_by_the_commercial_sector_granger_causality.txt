GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0093
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0081
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0087
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0093
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0209
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0174
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0189
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0209
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0072
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0049
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0059
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0072
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0119
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0076
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0094
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0119
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0512
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0355
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0409
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0512
RESULT:
                
    90.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector CAUSES GDP.
