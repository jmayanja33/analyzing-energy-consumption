Null Hypothesis: Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE GDP       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.2786
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.2735
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.2742
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.2786
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0004
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0003
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0004
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0033
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0021
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0026
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0033
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0296
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0211
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0243
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0296
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector CAUSES GDP.
