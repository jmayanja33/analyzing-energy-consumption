GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Commercial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.4985
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4944
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.4946
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.4985
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0039
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0028
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0033
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0039
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0031
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0016
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0022
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0031
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.3221
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.283
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.2923
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.3221
RESULT:
                
    60.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Commercial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector.
