GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Industrial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.4764
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4721
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.4724
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.4764
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0248
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0209
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0225
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0248
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0005
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0004
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0005
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0907
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0731
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0788
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0907
RESULT:
                
    50.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Industrial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector.
