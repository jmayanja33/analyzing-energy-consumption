GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: End Use Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0065
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0056
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.006
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0065
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0058
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0033
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0044
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0058
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.2941
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.2556
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.265
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.2941
RESULT:
                
    80.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that End Use Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector.
