- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.2847
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.2797
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.2804
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.2847
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0593
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0527
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0551
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0593
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.4284
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4091
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.4126
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.4284
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.2527
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.2251
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.232
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.2527
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.4288
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.3894
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.3976
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.4288
RESULT:

    0.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is less than the Causal Threshold set at 80.0.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be ACCEPTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector.
