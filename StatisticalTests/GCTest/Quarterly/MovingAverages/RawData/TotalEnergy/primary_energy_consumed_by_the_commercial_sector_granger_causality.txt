GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.4283
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4237
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.4241
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.4283
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1601
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1498
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1525
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1601
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0225
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0172
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0193
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0225
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1216
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1011
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1074
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1216
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.3322
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.293
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.3021
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.3322
RESULT:
                
    20.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector CAUSES Total Energy.
