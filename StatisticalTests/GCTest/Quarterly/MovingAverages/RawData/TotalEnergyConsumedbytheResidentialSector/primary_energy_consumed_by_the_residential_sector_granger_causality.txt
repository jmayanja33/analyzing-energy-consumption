GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.5302
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.5262
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.5264
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.5302
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0001
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1097
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0844
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0922
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1097
RESULT:
                
    60.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector.
