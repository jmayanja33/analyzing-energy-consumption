GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.113
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1086
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1098
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.113
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0001
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1173
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0911
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0991
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1173
RESULT:
                
    60.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector.
