GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Industrial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.3901
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.3853
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.3858
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.3901
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0037
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0027
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0032
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0037
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0005
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0003
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0005
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Industrial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector.
