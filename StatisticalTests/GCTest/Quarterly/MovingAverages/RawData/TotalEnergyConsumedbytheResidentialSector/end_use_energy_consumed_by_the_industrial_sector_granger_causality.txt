GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: End Use Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.9499
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.9494
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.9494
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.9499
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0009
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0005
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0007
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0009
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0003
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0003
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0007
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0003
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0004
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0007
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that End Use Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector.
