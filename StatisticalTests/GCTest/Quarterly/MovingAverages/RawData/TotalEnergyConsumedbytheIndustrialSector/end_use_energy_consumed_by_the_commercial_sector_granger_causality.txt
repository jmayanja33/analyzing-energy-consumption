GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: End Use Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0626
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0591
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0603
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0626
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0118
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0094
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0105
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0118
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0005
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0004
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0005
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0111
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.007
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0087
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0111
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that End Use Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector.
