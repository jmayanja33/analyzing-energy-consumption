GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1662
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1614
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1624
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1662
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.183
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1722
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.175
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.183
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0113
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0081
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0095
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0113
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0756
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0598
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0651
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0756
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.4037
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.3642
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.3727
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.4037
RESULT:
                
    20.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector.
