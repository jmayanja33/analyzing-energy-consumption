GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0124
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.011
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0116
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0124
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0061
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0046
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0054
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0061
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0014
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0008
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0011
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0014
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0013
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0006
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0009
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0013
RESULT:
                
    100.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector.
