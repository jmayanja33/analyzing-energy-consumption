GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Residential Sector Electrical System Energy Losses DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0228
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0207
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0216
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0228
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0134
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0108
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.012
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0134
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0309
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0243
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0269
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0309
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0099
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0061
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0077
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0099
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.5367
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4999
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.5067
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.5367
RESULT:
                
    80.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Residential Sector Electrical System Energy Losses CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector.
