GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0046
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0038
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0042
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0046
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0006
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0004
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0005
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0006
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0247
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.019
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0213
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0247
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0035
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0018
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0026
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0035
RESULT:
                
    100.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector.
