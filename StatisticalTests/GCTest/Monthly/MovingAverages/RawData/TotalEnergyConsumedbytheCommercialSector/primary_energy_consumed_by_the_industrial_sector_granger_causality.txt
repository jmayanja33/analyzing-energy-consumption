GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.204
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.2023
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.2026
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.204
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.9833
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.9832
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.9832
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.9833
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0251
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0231
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0239
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0251
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0734
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0681
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.07
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0734
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.4986
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4865
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.4888
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.4986
RESULT:
                
    20.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector.
