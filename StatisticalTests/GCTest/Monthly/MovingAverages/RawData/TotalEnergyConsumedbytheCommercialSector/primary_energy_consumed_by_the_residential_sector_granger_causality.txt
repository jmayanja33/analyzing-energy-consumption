GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0064
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0061
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0062
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0064
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.5549
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.5518
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.5521
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.5549
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0005
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0004
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0004
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0005
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0424
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0386
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0401
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0424
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector.
