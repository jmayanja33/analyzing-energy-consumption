GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.9121
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.9119
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.9119
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.9121
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.278
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.2741
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.2749
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.278
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0033
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0028
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.003
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0033
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0397
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.036
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0374
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0397
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.4339
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4213
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.4239
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.4339
RESULT:
                
    40.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector.
