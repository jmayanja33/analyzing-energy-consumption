GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0174
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0168
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0171
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0174
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.583
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.58
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.5803
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.583
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.002
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0017
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0018
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.002
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0435
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0396
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0411
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0435
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector.
