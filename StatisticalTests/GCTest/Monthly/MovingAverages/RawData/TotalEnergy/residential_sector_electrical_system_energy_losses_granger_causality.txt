- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.9429
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.9427
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.9427
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.9429
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.431
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4274
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.4279
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.431
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0135
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0122
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0128
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0135
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0036
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.003
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0033
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0036
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.442
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4295
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.432
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.442
RESULT:
                
    40.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Residential Sector Electrical System Energy Losses CAUSES Total Energy.
