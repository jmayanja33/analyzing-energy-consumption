- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0065
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0062
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0064
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0065
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0014
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.001
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0012
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0014
RESULT:
                
    100.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy.
