GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: End Use Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.9293
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.9291
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.9291
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.9293
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.3652
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.3615
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.3621
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.3652
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.4673
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4612
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.4622
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.4673
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.9571
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.9559
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.956
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.9571
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.4911
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.4789
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.4812
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.4911
RESULT:

    0.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is less than the Causal Threshold set at 80.0.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be ACCEPTED, and it is concluded that End Use Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy.
