GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1126
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1111
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1115
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1126
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0838
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0812
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.082
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0838
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0015
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0013
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0014
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0015
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0129
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0113
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.012
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0129
RESULT:
                
    50.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector.
