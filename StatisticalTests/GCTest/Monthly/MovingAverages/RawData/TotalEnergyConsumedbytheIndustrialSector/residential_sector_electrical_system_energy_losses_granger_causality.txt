GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Residential Sector Electrical System Energy Losses DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.192
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1903
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1906
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.192
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.2038
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.2001
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.201
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.2038
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0434
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0405
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0416
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0434
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0844
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0787
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0807
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0844
RESULT:

    25.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is less than the Causal Threshold set at 50.0.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be ACCEPTED, and it is concluded that Residential Sector Electrical System Energy Losses DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector.
