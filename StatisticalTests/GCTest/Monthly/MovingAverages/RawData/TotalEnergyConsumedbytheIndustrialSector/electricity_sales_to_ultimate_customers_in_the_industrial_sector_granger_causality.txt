GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Industrial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.7674
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.7667
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.7667
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.7674
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0443
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0424
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0431
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0443
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.005
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0044
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0047
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.005
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0008
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0006
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0007
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0008
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Industrial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector.
