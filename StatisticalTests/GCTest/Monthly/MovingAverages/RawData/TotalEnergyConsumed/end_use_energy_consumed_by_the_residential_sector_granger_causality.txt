GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: End Use Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.005
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0047
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0049
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.005
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0142
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0133
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0137
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0142
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0011
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0009
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.001
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0011
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.2829
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.2737
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.2759
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.2829
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that End Use Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed.
