GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0138
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0133
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0135
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0138
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1079
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.105
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1059
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1079
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0032
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0028
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.003
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0032
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.005
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0042
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0046
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.005
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Total Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed.
