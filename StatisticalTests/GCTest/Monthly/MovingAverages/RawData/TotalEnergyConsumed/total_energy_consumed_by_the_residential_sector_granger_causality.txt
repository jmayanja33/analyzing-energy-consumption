GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.5767
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.5755
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.5756
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.5767
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0656
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0633
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0641
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0656
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.018
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0164
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0171
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.018
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0188
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0166
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0175
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0188
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.7883
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.7815
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.7823
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.7883
RESULT:
                
    40.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed.
