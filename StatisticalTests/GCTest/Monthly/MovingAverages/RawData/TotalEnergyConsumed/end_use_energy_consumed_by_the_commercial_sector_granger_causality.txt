GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: End Use Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.3809
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.3793
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.3795
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.3809
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.5532
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.5501
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.5504
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.5532
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1777
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.172
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1735
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1777
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.8645
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.8613
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.8615
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.8645
RESULT:

    0.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is less than the Causal Threshold set at 50.0.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be ACCEPTED, and it is concluded that End Use Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed.
