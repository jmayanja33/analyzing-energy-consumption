GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Industrial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1123
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1108
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1112
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1123
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.19
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1864
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.1873
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.19
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0092
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0082
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0087
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0092
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.008
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0068
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0074
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.008
RESULT:
                
    50.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customers in the Industrial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector.
