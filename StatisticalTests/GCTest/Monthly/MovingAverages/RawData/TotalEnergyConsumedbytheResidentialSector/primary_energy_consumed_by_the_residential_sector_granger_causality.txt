GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1312
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1296
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.13
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1312
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0106
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0098
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0102
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0106
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0002
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0002
RESULT:
                
    75.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector.
