GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.1312
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.1296
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.13
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.1312
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0106
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0098
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0102
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0106
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0002
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0002
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0001
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0002
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0103
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0085
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0093
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0103
RESULT:
                
    80.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Primary Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector.
