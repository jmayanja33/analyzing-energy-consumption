GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy            

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.2488
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.2471
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.2474
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.2488
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0405
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0387
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0394
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0405
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.004
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0034
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0037
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.004
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0184
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0162
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0171
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0184
- Lag 5:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0719
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0652
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0675
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0719
RESULT:
                
    60.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 80.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that Total Energy Consumed by the Industrial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector.
