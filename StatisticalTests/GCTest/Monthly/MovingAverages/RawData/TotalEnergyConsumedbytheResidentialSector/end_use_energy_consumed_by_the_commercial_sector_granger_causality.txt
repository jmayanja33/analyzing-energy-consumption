GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST RESULTS

Null Hypothesis: End Use Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector DOES NOT CAUSE Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector       

- Lag 1:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.3248
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.3232
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.3234
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.3248
- Lag 2:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0923
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0895
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0904
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0923
- Lag 3:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0008
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0006
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0007
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0008
- Lag 4:
    - SSR Based Test P-Value: 0.0053
    - SSR Based chi2 Test P-Value: 0.0044
    - Likelihood Ratio Test P-Value: 0.0048
    - Parameter F Test P-Value: 0.0053
RESULT:
                
    50.0 % of the P-Values are lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    This number is greater than/equal to the Causal Threshold set at 50.0 %.
    Therefore, the null hypothesis will be REJECTED, and it is concluded that End Use Energy Consumed by the Commercial Sector CAUSES Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector.
